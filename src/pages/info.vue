    <p class="text-lg">Many may argue that all coffee tastes the same but the fact is that not all coffees are made the same.
        Think of the process that a bag of coffee you bought from the store went through. The beans themselves were grown
        in an environment that affecetd the way they grew. Next, the beans were processed in one of many ways or a combination of ways that
        had an effect on the taste as well. Lastly, the beans were roasted to a certain degree, at a certain temperature, in a certain apparatus. Now imagine that every bag or can of coffee in a grocery store 
        were sourced from different regions, processed in different ways, and roasted in their own unique way. With that being said, every coffee will have a subtle or major difference in taste that can be difficult to completely replicate.<br>

        <li class="bg-teal-400 p-4 rounded-2xl"><span class="text-2xl text-pink-500">Latin America</span><br>
        This region sources the most coffee led by Brazil.<br>
         Coffees from this region often taste chocolatey or nutty.<br>
         The tastes from this region can also be described as stronger<br> with less fruity tastes.</li>
        <li class="bg-yellow-500 p-4 rounded-2xl"><span class="text-2xl text-red-400">Africa</span><br>
        Africa is the birthplace of coffee where it was discovered<br> 
        in Ethiopia. Coffees from this region can be described as bright, fruity,<br> and acidic. Unlike Latin American and Asian Pacific coffees, <br>african sourced coffees can be described as lighter in taste.</li>
        <li class="bg-pink-300 p-4 rounded-2xl"><span class="text-2xl">Asia Pacific</span><br>
        Coffees grown in this region are often more robust and strong.<br> The processing method in this area also results in coffees<br> with an earthy and herbal taste. </li>
